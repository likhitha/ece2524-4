Project Description:

An arcade hub with optional GUI that can be used to collect, store, 
or remove collection of scores from various arcade games to a .csv file. 
You can record fields such as the game name, user name, score, and 
the placement of the score. Also, three buttons are available to 
obtain scores, commit scores, or remove scores from the collection.

Compile/Run Instructions:

NOTE: To compile the program you must have QT installed.
      Hub.py file must be in the same directory as qtWrapper.

To compile/run with GUI:

1. Open terminal and change directory.
2. Type in 'qmake' 
3. Type in 'make'
4. When the compilation is complete, type './qtWrapper' to run the GUI 
   interface.

To run in terminal:

Type in './Hub.py' with one of these options '--add', '--del', or '--list'
-  For '--add', you must enter three parameters: file to save the scores to 
   (without file extension), player name, and score.
-  For '--del', you must enter two parameters: file to delete the score from
   and player name.
-  For '--list', you must enter two parameters: file to list scores from
   and number of scores you want to view.
NOTE: When '--list' is used, the scores will be arranged from highest to lowest.
